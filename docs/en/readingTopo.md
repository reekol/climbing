## Chimney
![](assets/Chimney.svg)
A vertical crevice in the rock which is more than the width of the body (> 60cm). Chimneys can be climbed by stemming or bridging

## Chockstone
![](assets/Chockstone.svg)
A large rock or stone wedged in a chimney or crack

## Crack
![](assets/Crack.svg)
A crevice that is smaller than a chimney, although at times the line between crevices and chimneys is blurred

## Gully
![](assets/Gully.svg)
A vertical recess surrounded by rocks

## Dihedral
![](assets/Dihedral.svg)
Two rock faces or slabs which converge in the shape of an open book, usually with an internal crack. Climbing dihedrals involves shifting pressure: alternating between stemming the legs and supporting with the arms

## Edge
![](assets/Edge.svg)
Usually small to very small horizontal ledges that make good hand and foot holds.

## Slabs
![](assets/Slabs.svg)
Inclined rock with little structure. Friction is often used for climbing these

## Overhang
![](assets/Overhang.svg)
Rock with an incline of more than 90 degrees that is therefore steeper than vertical. This requires arm strength, as climbing is exhausting

## Roof
![](assets/Roof.svg)
An almost horizontal overhang where climbing becomes more exhausting than on a vertical rock face

## Ramp
![](assets/Ramp.svg)
Steeply rising ledge/sloping surface. Warning: Ramps can often remain damp after rain.

## Ledge

: Horizontal pedestal on a rock face

## Pedestal, shoulder

## Cave / Hollow

## Water streaks
![](assets/Water-Streaks.svg)
Usually vertical erosion in limestone

## Boulders/ rubble
![](assets/Boulders-Rubble.svg)
## Snowfield, firn field
![](assets/SnowFirnField.svg)
## Cornice
![](assets/Cornice.svg)
Heavily compacted, overhanging snow deposit on rock edges

## Mountain pine
![](assets/MountainPine.svg)
Sufficiently thick mountain pines can serve as intermediate belay points.

## Tree
![](assets/Tree.svg)
Sufficiently thick trees can be solid fixed points.

## Grass
![](assets/Grass.svg)
Warning: Steep grassy slopes are dangerous when wet

## Fixed wire rope
![](assets/FixedWire.svg)
## Pendulum
![](assets/Pendulum.svg)
Climber must cross a rock passage swinging on a fixed rope

## Belay
![](assets/Belay.svg)
Securing point to which the lead climber or follower is secured by the fixed partner.

## Rappelling point
![](assets/RappellingPoint.svg)
Designated route for abseiling.

## Bivouac site

## Key spot
![](assets/KeySpot.svg)
Most difficult point on the climbing route
